# Quackle_Self_Play

In this project, the repo owner and Jon Allen had the Scrabble AI known as Quackle play itself in Speedy Player mode 250,000 times. We recorded all the words that were played at any point throughout the games.  Specifically, if Player 1 played ULLAGES, and then Player 2 played SYZYGY, hooking the S to make SULLAGES, then the words ULLAGES, SULLAGES and SYZYGY were all recorded in this script. The dictionary used was OWL3.  When OWL4 is released, the scripts will be run again (eventually). 

In this repo currently (1/26/19) are several text files containing the output of some scripts.  Primarily, the largest text file contains all the words that were played, including all the repeats.  The file has not been modified in any way.  All the remaining text files are results of processing allthewords.txt.  Of particular interest was how the power tiles (JQXZ) were used by Quackle, and what 2, 3, 4, and 5 letter words were used most often; those data are in their respective text files.

This repo will eventually contain the code used to create all the images in the big image.
